# Subjective-Answer-Script-Evaluation
The field of educational assessment deals with the laborious and resource-heavy
process of manually grading subjective answer sheets. Subjective responses require
human judgment to evaluate quality, clarity, and adherence to the question prompt in
a student's answer, unlike objective questions with clear answer choices. This
conventional method has various disadvantages. Grading a large number of answer
scripts by hand can take up a significant amount of time, resulting in delays in giving
students useful feedback. Additionally, the procedure could be very costly, especially
for extensive evaluations, because it demands significant resources to recruit and
educate human graders. Possibly the most worrisome restriction involves the
possibility of discrepancies among graders.
